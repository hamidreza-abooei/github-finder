# Github User Finder
This repository is my first Front-end project for Internet Engineering course in dept. Computer Engineering @AUT
Using this project you can search a GitHub username and it's information will be shown right besides it.

You can access the website through this link: [https://hamidreza-abooei.github.io/github-finder/](https://hamidreza-abooei.github.io/github-finder/)   
I should note that this project is still under developement.
